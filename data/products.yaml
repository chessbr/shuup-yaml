Just fill your dog’s bowl with the antioxidant-rich nutrition in Beneful Originals With Real Beef and you’re giving him 100% of the nutrients he needs to help him thrive every day. All in a mix of tender and crunchy bites dogs love. It’s everyday healthy and all kinds of yum. What Are Beneful Originals Dry Dog Food? Nutritious blends with real wholesome ingredients. All perfectly balanced to give your dog the nutrition he needs to help him thrive plus that taste he loves. There are three varieties--Beneful Originals With Real Beef, Real Chicken or Real Salmon—each with their own unique ingredient blends and flavors. So every meal can be awesome.
Feeding Adult Dogs Most adult dogs can be fed once daily. However, when high activity or other factors create a higher feed intake, twice-a-day feeding is recommended. Dogs should be maintained in ideal body condition and not allowed to become overweight. The food intake required to maintain ideal body condition will vary, depending on age, activity and environment. Consequently, the amount of food required for each dog will vary and should be adjusted accordingly. Feeding Tip When switching your dog to Beneful Healthy Weight dog food, please allow 7-10 days for the transition. Gradually add more Beneful Healthy Weight and less of the previous food to your dog's dish each day until the changeover is complete. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. Provide adequate fresh water in a clean container daily. For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly Store in a cool, dry place."

        en: 'Proven Premium Quality. American birders top choice; For birds of North America; Attracts a variety of wildbirds; Seeds will not germinate. Be patient. Attracting birds can become a great source of pleasure. Sometimes birds keep you waiting a long time. If your feeder is new expect several weeks to pass before birds find it. The first birds to show up will be the most common species for your area. Others will eventually notice the commotion and join in.
Directions: How to Attract Wild Birds. Wild birds, like other forms of wildlife, need food, shelter, water, and safe haven for living. You have purchased a quality wild bird food that will be in high demand once your feathered friends find your feeding stations. You can begin feeding wild birds any time of the year. For best results put your feeding station in a dry area, yet away from the wind. Make sure that the area is close to a shelter such as tree or shrub about 6 to 10 feet. Pick an area that has easy access. Try a feeder that is suspended or mounted along with a ground feeding tray, or better yet a natural log. Water is also extremely important. Birds need drinking and bathing water just as much as food. Moving shallow water attracts birds especially during the warmer months. Most of all put your feeding stations and water where you can watch and enjoy the birds throughout the entire day. Ingredients: Thistle Seed.'

Product Description
Edgy is precisely the word to describe Fluval EDGE. It's so out there on so many fronts; it's cool, trendy, breathtaking, contemporary and stylish. Its striking 3D cube design is refreshingly new and revolutionary. EDGE is an eye-catching showpiece that stands out anywhere you put it. It includes LED lighting, so it makes a spectacular substitute for tabletop lamps. EDGE consists of two main components working in perfect harmony: a clear glass aquarium nestled inside an elegant pedestal. The pedestal appears to be clasping the tank, making the aquarium appear like it is suspended in mid-air. The column houses the filter and the electrical wiring is neatly concealed inside the column. EDGE has a clear glass top that allows a clear and virtually unobstructed aerial view of the interior. The cover is completely sealed, which allows you to fill the aquarium right up to the brim, creating a spectacular effect. Water evaporation is minimal. The unobtrusive pedestal structure and the clear top allow a great all-around view. Instead of a traditional canopy, there is a small cover at the top that houses the lighting. EDGE comes in two sizes 6 and 12 gallons. Both models are ideal for countertops, desks and tabletops. The 6 gallon model includes 21 LED bulbs—18 white and 3 blue bulbs. Visually Stunning A powerful, retractable LED lighting system creates a visually stunning display.

A powerful, retractable LED lighting system creates a visually stunning display. The Edge is equipped with both white and blue LED bulbs, giving you the ability to provide full illumination or a night-time moonlight effect. The 6 gallon aquarium comes with a 21-bulb lighting system and the 12 gallon comes with 42 bulbs. Both models have a three position on/off switch for the ability to display Bright Daytime, Deep Blue Nighttime and Off. Versatile Design The Fluval EDGE aquarium has been designed for today's lifestyle with a contoured casing module and a 6-sided glass tank. Whether in an ultra-modern or more traditional setting, this versatile aquarium adds the 'designer' look to almost any room in the home. The gentle flow of water and glow of the LED lighting produce a beautiful shimmering effect reminiscent to sunlight on open water. Easy to Operate and Quiet EDGE is quiet, powerful and easy to use aquarium that turns fish-keeping into an extraordinary visual experience. Display Anywhere in Your Home The Fluval EDGE has been designed to be filled to the top. The action of the filter provides all the oxygen exchange fish need. This means that the aquarium can be positioned at a lower level and viewed clearly from above through the glass top, unhindered by equipment or trailing wires."

Chicken, beef & turkey flavors accented with garden veggies & grill flavor. Fire up the flavor with this purrific blend of tender and crunchy deliciousness.
After Exploring & Playing, It's Time to Refuel. These amounts are averages and your cat's needs may differ. So feeding should be adjusted as necessary to maintain an ideal body condition. Want some variety? Serve it up by feeding your cat Purina Friskies canned in addition to or mixed with Purina Friskies dry. Remember, cats are nibblers who enjoy eating small amounts throughout the day, so your cat would appreciate it if you keep a bowl of Purina Friskies dry cat food available at all times. Keep in mind, pregnant and nursing cats may require 2-4 times their normal feeding. Lucky Enough to Have a Kitten? Kittens generally nibble solid food at 3-4 weeks of age. Keep moistened Purina Friskies available to these kittens at all times. After weaning (at 6-8 weeks of age), kittens will normally eat dry or moistened foods at will. If water is added, use no more than one part warm (not hot) liquid to three parts Purina Friskies, changing frequently to ensure freshness. Curious About Other Friskies Flavors? Remember, changes in your cat's diet should be made gradually to allow your cat to become accustomed to a new food. Substitute small amounts of the new food for the old food, gradually increasing the amount of the new food while decreasing the old food, over a period of 7-10 days. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets--something both you and your cat can appreciate. Provide adequate fresh water in a clean container daily. For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly.
